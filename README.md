ASL Sign Language Classifier with MediaPipe & Scikit-learn

This project uses real-time webcam input and machine learning to detect and classify American Sign Language (ASL) hand signs. It leverages MediaPipe for hand landmark detection and scikit-learn for training a gesture recognition model.

📸 What it does:
Captures hand landmarks from webcam input using MediaPipe

Trains a Random Forest Classifier to recognize ASL letters

Classifies gestures in real-time with a visual bounding box and label overlay
